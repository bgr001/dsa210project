# dsa210project
A repo for my DSA210 project, term 2402.

Project Proposal
----
I plan to use the WHO's mortality database to analyze suicide rates over time by age group. My analysis will be enriched by data on economics recessions and possibly war periods in the U.S. I aim to expolore how times of crisis affect suicide rates and how these effects might vary by different age groups.

Dates of U.S. recessions: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JHDUSRGDPBR (economic indicators such as declines in GDP could show the severity of the recessions in this database, % change in real GDP could be used)
